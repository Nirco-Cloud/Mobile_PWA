## [Unreleased]

---

## [1.6.0] — 2026-03-01

### Changed
- "→ Tomorrow" button on EntryCard replaced with "📅 Day" — opens DayPicker overlay to move entry to any day (not just the next one)
- DayPicker gains `pickerOnly` prop: skips entry creation, fires `onDone(day)` with the chosen day number; header reads "Move to day"; toast reads "Moved to Day X ✓"
- Edit form now shows a Description / Note textarea for **all** entry types (was Note-only for `type='note'`)
  - Label shows "Description" for non-note types, "Note" for note type
  - Stored in `entry.note` field
  - Saved description is displayed as a small gray line below the entry name on the card
- Saving a description on a location entry that has a `locationId` also updates the linked location's `description` field in IndexedDB, making it findable in the Map view search bar

---

## [1.5.0] — 2026-03-01

### Changed
- Import flow now uses the same modern DayPicker sheet (5-col grid, amber today, past days hidden)
- "Add to Day →" in ImportSheet: saves location immediately, resets form, opens DayPicker as overlay
- Cancel DayPicker → location stays in saved list, no plan entry created
- Each saved import now has a "+ Plan" button to open DayPicker at any time without re-pasting
- DayPicker gains optional `onDone` prop (called after successful save, distinct from `onClose` cancel)

### Removed
- Old inline 3-column day picker inside ImportSheet (replaced by full DayPicker overlay)

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-03-01

### Added
- "+ Plan" button in expanded LocationRow action row (alongside Open in Maps and Share)
- Modern day-picker bottom sheet: 5-column grid, blurred backdrop, rounded-3xl corners
- Each day cell shows: day-of-week, date number, month, day number (D3), green dot if already has entries
- Today highlighted with amber ring and "today" badge
- Hard cutoff: past days hidden — only today and future days shown
- If trip hasn't started yet, all days shown from Day 1
- Success toast "Added to Day X ✓" shown for 1.2s then sheet closes automatically

---

## [1.3.1] — 2026-03-01

### Changed
- Category chip tap from "All on" state now isolates to that chip only (no need to clear first)
- "All" chip always resets to show everything
- Active category filter persisted to IndexedDB — survives app crash, close, and phone restart

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-03-01

### Added
- Horizontal scrollable category chip row pinned between search bar and location list
- 11 merged chip groups consolidate 16 raw categories into clean labels (Izakaya, Ramen, Sushi, Fine Dining, Street Food, Cafe, Snacks, Shopping, Sights, Hotels, Other)
- Each chip group maps multiple related internal keys (e.g. Sushi = both Hebrew sushi keys; Cafe = Hebrew + imported cafe keys)
- Active chip shows colored fill + white dot; "All" chip resets filter

### Removed
- Full-screen CategoryFilter overlay (replaced by chip row)
- "Categories" tab from bottom navigation bar (now 3 tabs: Map, Plan, Settings)

---

## [1.2.1] — 2026-03-01

### Changed
- Trip Planner opens at 85% screen height by default (was 65%)

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-03-01

### Changed
- Drag handles (map/list divider and planner panel) now animate smoothly to snap point on release
  - `transition: none` during drag — panel follows finger instantly with zero lag
  - `transition: height 200ms ease-out` activates only at finger lift — glides to snap point
  - Tap-to-cycle also animates smoothly

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-01

### Added
- Version number displayed at the bottom of the Settings tab (`v{version}`)
- Version injected at build time from `package.json` via Vite `define`
- Import categories refactored to entry-type system: Restaurant, Cafe, Attraction, Shop, Hotel, Train, Place
  - Hotel/Train imports create matching plan entry types (`type:'hotel'`, `type:'train'`)
  - All other import categories create `type:'location'` plan entries
  - Auto-detection maps place name keywords to the appropriate category
- Import-first add-to-planner flow: Google Maps link → resolve → pick category → pick day → saved directly as plan entry
- Inline day picker inside ImportSheet (no separate overlay)
- Tap-to-cycle on both drag handles: single tap cycles through snap points without dragging

### Changed
- Trip Planner drag handle: hit target increased from 32px → 48px
- Map/List divider drag handle: hit target increased from 20px → 48px
- Drag move/up listeners moved from handle element to `window` — no more lost touch when finger moves outside handle
- `touchAction: none` applied to outer container during drag to prevent scroll hijack
- `requestAnimationFrame` throttling on both drag handles for smooth 120Hz updates
- Snap points: Planner panel 35/65/85%, Map divider 30/50/70%
- Removed "+ Plan" button from LocationRow expanded section
- Removed "+ Location" button from TodayView in PlannerOverlay
- Import category chips replaced old Hebrew/Japanese food categories

### Fixed
- Trip dates showing 27/02→27/02 in Settings: stale IndexedDB value cleared automatically when start === end
- Category state reset bugs in ImportSheet (save-only and sheet-close handlers)
